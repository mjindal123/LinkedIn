Level 1:
1st: Understand data science! If you cannot explain linear or logistic regression in depth, study harder!

2nd: Walk the talk via programming. You know in and out the tools and techniques to clean, transform, and tidy up your data and build models. SQL is a must here.


Level 2:
3rd: Problem solving. Given a business problem, how can you frame it to a technical one with feasible solution? What data do you need to collect? What are the assumptions and limitations? How to communicate your findings to various audience?

4th: Research many companies, think about their potential problems, how will you solve them? Think hard and use that as ideas to build your personal projects to impress future employers.

5th: Let the problems in 4th drive your learning. If it requires knowing time series, A/B testing, or operation research, go study it!


If Level 2 completed, then:

6th: Apply to positions that are close to data scientist such as internship, marketing or data analyst. Your chance will increase ten folds!

7th: Go above and beyond in 6th.

8th: #DataScience will be waiting for you :)

Else: Back to Level 1

Tell us some of the common data quality issues faced in modelling? 
• Data type issues — Values in column should be same data type 
• Range constraints — Data falling within minimum & max value : probability 
• Mandatory constraints - Certain column can't be empty 
• Unique constraints — a field must be unique across datasets 
• Value constraint — Gender column can only be male or female 
• Constraint on patter — Phone should have ISD code within bracket 
• Spelling error 
• Missing Value & the reason behind 
• Outlier Detection 
• Cross field Validation — date of joining cant be before date of birth

Introduction to Churn Prediction in Python
Tutorial here ---> http://bit.ly/2Ij82hD

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide for predicting churn using Python. Boosting algorithms are fed with historical user information in order to make predictions. This type of pipeline is a basic predictive technique that can be used as a foundation for more complex models.

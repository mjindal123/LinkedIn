Aspiring data scientists: ignore the job descriptions and apply anyway.

By now, you must realize that "data scientist" could mean anything and everything.

Most companies throw together job descriptions by spamming buzz words and requesting a PhD with 10 years of experience.  They ask for something that isn't even close to realistic.

What does this tell us?

It tells us that a lot of companies don't actually know what they want.  They don't know what they want, so they request everything.  If they get everything, that will be enough, right?

    *Don't fall for their trap.*

A job description written by someone that doesn't know what they want doesn't mean anything. 

Job description != actual responsibilities
Job description != actual requirements 
Job description != work contract

Do yourself a favor and ignore job description.

Think about how you can contribute to a company beyond the listed responsibilities.  Think about what your unique skill set will bring to the team.

See a job that you're interested in? Apply.

Then let the recruiters and managers know you applied and why you think you would be a great fit.

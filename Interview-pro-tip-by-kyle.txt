Don't let people reject you in interviews by telling you that you don't have the skills they need.

Instead, ignore them and ask about the problem they're trying to solve.

Start digging in and understanding what they're trying to do. What's the business problem? Why is solving it important? What data do they have access to? What approaches have they tried in the past?

Then, you can start advising them on different approaches they could take and the skills needed to execute those solutions.

By the end of it, you should have articulated exactly how to solve their most critical problems while simultaneously describing yourself.

Once you finish explaining what they should be doing, shut up and listen to their feedback.

If they like your plan, they're eventually going to ask "how do we do that?" or "do you know someone who can do that?"

At that point, you can tell them "yes, I have the skills to do all of that for you."

Remember, it's your job to pitch your skills in the interview and not let other people's false assumptions hold you back.

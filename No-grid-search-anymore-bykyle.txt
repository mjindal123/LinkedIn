Anyone else totally avoid using grid search because it's so inefficient?

Want to make automated hyperparameter tuning faster and more effective?

➡️ I've been searching a bit and recently starting playing around with the hyperband tuning algorithm.

It's a "novel bandit-based approach to hyperparamter tuning."

Check out the research paper here:

And an article from FastML:

And what appears to the most popular Python implementation so far:

➡️ Anybody else have experience using hyperband (or novel random search or greedy algorithms) to optimize hyperparameter tuning?

What have you found to be most useful?

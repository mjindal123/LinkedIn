There are courses (for now) on:

- R: Learn the language designed for data analysis. This track includes data set-up, machine learning and data visualization.

- Data Visualization: Visualisation is one of the most versatile skills in data science. Make insightful and beautiful graphics to see what's happening in any dataset.

- Deep Learning: Take Machine Learning to the next level. With TensorFlow and Keras, and then amaze yourself with what new things you can do.

Whether searching for a job or trying to hire in data science or elsewhere, consider three things: business model, innovation and development:

1) How does company make money or make a contribution?
2) How does the company innovate and keep pace with industry?
3) How does the company help employees develop?

Why these questions?

1) If it is not clear how the company makes money or what its business model is, that is a RED ALERT.

As a company, try to help candidates understand this. As a candidate, ask questions that make clear you understand the importance of the business model to company success.

2) If the company does not innovate, particularly in a field like data science, that is a warning sign. Without clear innovation, I would be worried about my long term prospects in a company.

As a company, focus on how you push boundaries of the industry. As a candidate, try to understand the company well enough to suggest ways in which the company could innovate!

3) Both employees and employers have a vested interest in the employee developing new skills while working there.

As a company, have a clear, detailed plan for employee development. As a candidate, show your interest in learning new skills!

What other factors do you consider either in hiring or job searching?
